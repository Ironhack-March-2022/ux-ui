UX / UI <-> Devs
----------------

My thoughts about the process, the mechanisms that are important, how do developers think / what is important for them


- coding week might have given you the wrong impression: html / css is boring | it is also not the main part of frontend development

- frontend development got interesting because of the functionality - most devs hate html and css


Things that are important in current software development:
- everybody wants to be agile | Agile Software Development
- estimating time



- principle: single source of truth

- don't bullshit, most (good) developers are really allergic to that

- principle: one week of coding can save you hours of planning


- therefore the dev team needs as soon as possible a solid idea of the 'functionality' of the feature / e.g.
how does the user move through the site / app

- communicate with the dev team as soon as possible if this is not institutionalized

- try to speak a language that they understand 

- the bigger the company the more likely they have a design system | makes everything easier 


- you want to prevent having 'pipedreams' that cannot be done | consult the dev team for technical feasibility / might be possible as a stand alone app - but as an additional feature might involve too much changes to an existing codebase
| almost everything is doable the question is at which costs

- you might also need to check technical capabilities of the tech team | design could be too complicated

Handoff
-------

handoff: is there a style guide if yes, don't duplicate information (principle single source of truth)
!! listen for what the dev team needs in terms of requirements / specifications

- stick to all naming and other conventions !!!!

- naming is an immensely important thing in software development !!!!

## Handoff should contain: 
Design
- color styles
- text styles | fonts etc., font-size, line-height, font-weight
- possibly other styles like box-shadows etc

- grid specifications
- spacing of the elements | breakpoints for responsive design

- all images and assets

Functionality / Behaviour
- prototype or flowchart


- providing a prototype along with the handoff is always great | big part of the implementation is the functionality / user flow

- the frontend devs mental model of the screens will be : components

- that some things are not doable / don't work that way will only be found out by the devs when they are building it

- when the feature is built : after the iteration is before the iteration -> agile !!!
